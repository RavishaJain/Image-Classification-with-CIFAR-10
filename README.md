# Image-Classification-with-CIFAR-10
The goal of this project is to implement image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using two different approaches: a traditional Neural Network (NN) and a more specialized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, making it a suitable benchmark for image classification tasks.

**Project Steps:**

1. Dataset Exploration:
Download and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Explore the dataset to understand its structure, including the number of classes, images, and dimensions.

2. Data Preprocessing:
Normalize the pixel values of images to the range [0, 1].
One-hot encodes the labels for both training and testing sets.

3. Neural Network (NN) Implementation:
Design a traditional Neural Network architecture for image classification.
Choose an appropriate activation function, loss function, and optimizer.
Train the NN on the training set and validate on a separate validation set.
Evaluate the performance of the NN on the test set.

4. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Implementation:
Design a Convolutional Neural Network architecture tailored for image classification.
Include convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
Choose suitable activation functions, loss functions, and optimizers.
Train the CNN on the training set and validate on a separate validation set.
Evaluate the performance of the CNN on the test set.

5. Performance Comparison:
Compare the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of the NN and CNN models.
Visualize and analyze the confusion matrices for both models.
Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each model.

6. Model Interpretation:
Use techniques like activation maximization or saliency maps to interpret the learned features by the CNN.
Analyze misclassifications to identify patterns or classes that are challenging for each model.

7. Fine-tuning and Optimization:
Experiment with hyperparameter tuning to improve the performance of both models.
Consider data augmentation to enhance the generalization of the models.

8. Conclusion:
Summarize the findings and highlight the differences in performance between the NN and CNN models.
Discuss the practical implications and potential use cases for each model in image classification tasks.
